# QemuKernelBase
Building out kernel features for educational purposes

Uses docker to build kernel images, windows and linux scripts are available to do this. Windows is 'build.bat' and Linux is 'dockerbuild.sh'. It should just pull my image from docker hub.

kernel.c and boot.s have the juiciest code rn if thats what you're looking for
